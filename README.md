## Project Skeleton

A basic skeleton that can be used for quickly starting new PHP projects.

Includes the following:

- Composer.json file for dependency management
- PHPUnit for unit testing
- Psalm for code quality analysis
- Minimum PHP version set to PHP 7.4

## How To

To start a new project using this template you just need to:

1. Clone this repo (or click "Use this template" on Github)
2. Delete the `.git` folder and then run `git init`
3. Update the `composer.json` file with
    1. Your project name
    2. Your project description
    3. Your preferred license
    4. Your desired PSR-4 namespace
4. Install dependencies with `composer install`
5. Delete the `Example` class and associated test
6. Start creating your project! ðŸŽ‰

## Development

While there is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to development, there are best
practices that can substantially improve code quality and thus lead to better
outcomes. You are free to develop however you want, but for those who want peace
of mind this scaffold comes pre-packed with some additional useful tools.

Use or remove them as you see fit.
